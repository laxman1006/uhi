        ADHD is one of the most common <a>neurodevelopmental</a> disorders of
        childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts
        into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention,
        controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the
        result will be), or be overly active.
      </p>
      <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
      <p>
        It is normal for children to have trouble focusing and behaving at one
        time or another. However, children with ADHD do not just grow out of
        these behaviors. The symptoms continue, can be severe, and can cause
        difficulty at school, at home, or with friends.
      </p>
      <p>A child with ADHD might:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>daydream a lot</li>
        <li>forget or lose things a lot</li>
        <li>squirm or fidget</li>
        <li>talk too much </li>
        <li>make careless mistakes or take unnecessary risks</li>
        <li>have a hard time resisting temptation</li>
        <li>have trouble taking turns</li>
        <li>have difficulty getting along with others</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Types</h3>
      <p>There are </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Predominantly Inattentive Presentation:</strong> It is hard
          for the individual to organize or finish a task, to pay attention to
          details, or to follow instructions or conversations. The person is
          easily distracted or forgets details of daily routines.
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          <strong>Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation:</strong> The
          person fidgets and talks a lot. It is hard to sit still for long
          (e.g., for a meal or while doing homework). Smaller children may run,
          jump or climb constantly. The individual feels restless and has
          trouble with impulsivity. Someone who is impulsive may interrupt
          others a lot, grab things from people, or speak at inappropriate
          times. It is hard for the person to wait their turn or listen to
          directions. A person with impulsiveness may have more accidents and
          injuries than others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Combined Presentation:</strong> Symptoms of the above two
          types are equally present in the person. Because symptoms can change
          over time, the presentation may change over time as well.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Causes of ADHD</h3>
      <p>
        Scientists are studying cause(s) and risk factors in an effort to find
        better ways to manage and reduce the chances of a person having ADHD.
        The cause(s) and risk factors for ADHD are unknown, but current research
        shows that genetics plays an important role. Recent studies of twins
        link genes with ADHD.1
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to genetics, scientists are studying other possible causes
        and risk factors including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brain injury</li>
        <li>
          Exposure to environmental (e.g., lead) during pregnancy or at a young
          age
        </li>
        <li>Alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy</li>
        <li>Premature delivery</li>
        <li>Low birth weight</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Research does not support the popularly held views that ADHD is caused
        by eating too much sugar, watching too much television, parenting, or
        social and environmental factors such as poverty or family chaos. Of
        course, many things, including these, might make symptoms worse,
        especially in certain people. But the evidence is not strong enough to
        conclude that they are the main causes of ADHD.
      </p>
      <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
      <p>
        >Deciding if a child has ADHD is a process with several steps. There is
        no single test to diagnose ADHD, and many other problems, like anxiety,
        depression, sleep problems, and certain types of learning disabilities,
        can have similar symptoms. One step of the process involves having a
        medical exam, including hearing and vision tests, to rule out other
        problems with symptoms like ADHD. Diagnosing ADHD usually includes a
        checklist for rating ADHD symptoms and taking a history of the child
        from parents, teachers, and sometimes, the child.

      <h3>Treatments</h3>
      <p>
        In most cases, ADHD is best treated with a combination of behavior
        therapy and medication. For preschool-aged children (4-5 years of age)
        with ADHD, behavior therapy, particularly training for parents, is
        recommended as the first line of treatment before medication is tried.
        What works best can depend on the child and family. Good treatment plans
        will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and making changes, if
        needed, along the way.

      <h3>Managing Symptoms: Staying Healthy</h3>
      <p>
        Being healthy is important for all children and can be especially
        important for children with ADHD. In addition to behavioral therapy and
        medication, having a healthy lifestyle can make it easier for your child
        to deal with ADHD symptoms. Here are some healthy behaviors that may
        help:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developing healthy eating habits such as eating plenty of fruits,
          vegetables, and whole grains and choosing lean protein sources
        </li>
        <li>Participating in daily physical activity based on age</li>
        <li>
          Limiting the amount of daily screen time from TVs, computers, phones,
          and other electronics
        </li>
        <li>Getting the recommended amount of sleep each night based on age</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Get Help!</h3>
